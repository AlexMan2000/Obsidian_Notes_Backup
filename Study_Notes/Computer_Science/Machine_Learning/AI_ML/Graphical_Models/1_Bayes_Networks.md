# Bayesian Network Representation
## Motivation
> [!bug] Curse of Dimensionality
> ![](1_Bayes_Networks.assets/image-20240303084456449.png)
> For example, if we want to model $P(X_1,X_{2,\cdots,}X_n|X_{n+1})$, if we assume $(X_{1,\cdots,}X_n)$ follows multivariable gaussian distribution, we would use $n+n^2$(mean vector plus covariance matrix) to represent.
> 
> But using bayesian independece assumption we only need 2 parameters for each conditional distribution $P(X_i|X_{n+1})~\forall n=1,2\cdots, n$. Thus in total we need only $2n$ parameters, which is a huge improvements.

> [!bug] Intuitive Attempt
> ![](1_Bayes_Networks.assets/image-20240303094327302.png)
> The reason why the above algorithm is not right is that if we shade Y, then X is not reachable to Z and thus $X\perp Z|Y$, but this is not true by our probablistic analysis. The reason is that such triples are considered active triples so actually $X$ is reachable to $Z$ even if $Y$ is shaded and seems to block the path.

> **The reasons are that:**
> 1. Some bayes net structure is computationally easier then others.
> 2. Some causal effects are more suitable to be represented by some specific structures. For example, if there is a chained causal relationship, then it's better to use causal chain model instead of common cause model.

> For the first ordering, when we eliminate factor $f(Z)$, we get a large factor $f(X_1,X_2,\cdots,X_{n})$(since we have $f(Z), f(X_i|Z)\forall i=1,2,\cdots, n$ to start with), which corresponds to $2^{n}$ rows in CPT.
> 
> For the second ordering, after eliminating $X_1$, we get small factor $f(Y_1,Z)$, which corresponds to $2^2$ rows in CPT.

# Bayesian Network Modeling
## Polynomial Regression Model
> [!def]
> If we have training data $\mathbf{x}=(x_1,x_{2,\cdots,}x_n)$ where $x_{i}\in\mathbb{R}$, and observed output data $\mathbf{t}=(t_1,t_{2,\cdots,}t_n)$ and polynomial regression  coefficients $\mathbf{w}=(w_1,w_{2,\cdots,}w_n)$.
> 
> Assume now we are using $l_2$ regularization on the polynomial regression where the prior of $\mathbf{w}$ is parametrized by $\alpha$, then it suffices to get the posterior distribution of $\mathbf{w}$ given $\mathbf{t},\mathbf{x},\sigma^2,\alpha$, mathematically it is: $$p(\mathbf{w}|\mathbf{t},\mathbf{x},\sigma^2,\alpha)$$
> 
> Recall that in polynomial regression the model is of the form: $$t_i=f(x_i,\mathbf{w})+z_i$$ where $z_{i}\sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2)$ where $f$ is the interaction term. Notice that the interaction is not linear since we are interacting between $\mathbf{w}$ and some transformed feature of $\mathbf{x}$. So polynomial regression doesn't necessarily belong to GLM(except when $n=1$ where the feature only has first-order term of $x$).
> 
> Given this we know $t_i$ is dependent on $x_i,\mathbf{w},\sigma^2$, and $\mathbf{w}$ is dependent on $\alpha$, we could use the following bayesian network to represent the model compactly:
> ![](1_Bayes_Networks.assets/image-20240304111447616.png)
> where the _plate_(in blue rectangular) represents ($x_{i}\to t_{i}$ connection $\forall i=1,2\cdots, n$). 
> 
> Then in order to compute the posterior distribution mentioned earlier, we use bayes rule:
>$$\begin{aligned}p(\mathbf{w}|\mathbf{t},\mathbf{x},\sigma^{2},\alpha)&\propto p(\mathbf{t}|\mathbf{w},\mathbf{x},\sigma^2)p(\mathbf{w}|\alpha)\end{aligned}$$
> 
> Finally we get: $$\begin{aligned}p(\mathbf{t}|\mathbf{w},\mathbf{x},\sigma^2)p(\mathbf{w}|\alpha)=\prod_{i=1}^{N}p(t_i|\mathbf{w},x_i,\sigma^2)p(\mathbf{w}|\alpha)\end{aligned}$$
> 
> We can maximize this posterior probability across all parameters to find the MAP estimator for our polynomial regression model.
> 
> Now suppose we want to predict $\widehat{t}$ given a new test point $\widehat{x}$, we have:
