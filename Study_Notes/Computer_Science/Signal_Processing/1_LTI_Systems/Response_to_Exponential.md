## Eigenfunction
> [!def]
>   An eigenfunction is a type of function that, when used as an input for a given operator, produces a result proportional to the original function. 
>   
>   The concept is most often discussed in the contexts of linear algebra, differential equations, and quantum mechanics, among other areas in mathematics and physics.
