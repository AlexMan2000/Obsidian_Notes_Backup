> Since $H$ may not be PSD, we know that the problem may not be convex. Because $\nabla^2f=H$ and if $H\succeq 0$, the objective is convex.

> Note that for any quadratic form for non-symmetric matrix $A$, which is $\vec{x}^{\top}A\vec{x}$, we can always transform it into the form of standard form by adding its symmetric counterpart.
