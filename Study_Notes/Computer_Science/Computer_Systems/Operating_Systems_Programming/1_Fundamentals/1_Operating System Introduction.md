> **Does a program becomes a process when loaded into the memory?**
> For now we can think of the program as the class template and process as an instantiaion of the program, so we could have multiple processes executing the same program, but probablly with different states.


## Process Protection

> When process 2 tries to access memory of process 1, or memory of the reserved portion of the operating system, or storage that are occupied by other users. Then segment fault is triggered.
