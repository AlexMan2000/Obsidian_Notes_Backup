# Blocking Lock
> [!def]
> **Blocking Locks (Mutexes)**: If the lock is a standard blocking lock (or mutex), the thread that attempts to acquire the lock will be put into a waiting state until the lock becomes available. When the thread holding the lock releases it, the operating system's scheduler will wake up one of the waiting threads (or all, depending on the policy) and allow it to acquire the lock.
