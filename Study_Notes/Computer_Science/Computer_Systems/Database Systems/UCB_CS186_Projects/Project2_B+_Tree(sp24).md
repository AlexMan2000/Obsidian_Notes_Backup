# Serialization
> [!concept]
> This project serialize the records to bytes in memory instead of serializing to file in file system, like in [P2102__Gitlet](../../../Data_Structures_Algorithms/Data_Structures/CS61B/16_Software_Projects/P2102__Gitlet.md).

# Task 1: LeafNode::fromBytes
> [!important]
> This deserializing method depends on how the LeafNode is serialized, so we have to take a look at `LeafNode::toBytes()`



# Task 2: get, getLeftmostLeaf, put, remove




# Task 3: Scans




# Task 4: Bulk Load
