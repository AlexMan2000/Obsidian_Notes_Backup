# Parametric Hypothesis Testing
> [!overview]
> Parametric hypothesis tests relies on a parametric model to describe the distribution of the test statistic.

# Nonparametric Hypothesis Testing
> [!overview]
> In practice, it can be challenging to design such parametric models
> 
> Fortunately, it is possible to perform hypothesis testing without parametric models.
