# Chapter 8.1 Government Budget Basics
## Government Bonds
> - `Unlike families, governments can choose to roll over its debt perpetually, without ever being debt free`. 可以一直保持`debt`(欠债的状态)。所以实际情况是，当`When public debt are due, government will issue more debts`.
> - `As long as the level of public debt is manageable`, in the sense that the rest of society does not believe it will grow uncontrollably, governments do not need to balance their books.
> - 政府主要有两种方式来`Finance Themselves`
> 	- 印钞`Print the Money`
> 	- Issue government bonds.

## Government Debts
### Primary Budget（Deficit）
> ![](Chapter_8_Government%20Budgets.assets/image-20230321144253902.png)
> `PB`就是政府的不能被税收覆盖的消费欲望，本质上是个`deficit`, 所以`G`在前面。
> `Debt`是按照时间来算的。
> - `Deficit` is the amount that you spend over what you own in the pervious period.就是上一阶段超支(欠债)的部分。简单来说就是入不敷出。`Deficit` can happen every year.
> - `Surplus`作为`Deficit`的反义词。
> - 总的来说`Budget`作为`Deficit/Surplus`的统称，如果`PB<0`, 就是`Surplus`, 如果`PB>0`, 就是`Deficit`。


### Total Budgets（Deficit）
> ![](Chapter_8_Government%20Budgets.assets/image-20230321144037074.png)
> - 这里的`D`就是上一个`Period`借的钱(`Total Budget`, 这些钱还没还，握在手里，在这个季度需要还`rD`)。还掉了就会少一点`deficit`, 所以前面是负号。
> - `r` 是`nominal interest`。
> - It is possible for government to have a total budget `TB` surplus and a total debt `D`.


## Why we need total budget and primary budget?
> - `Primary Budget`是政府能控制的部分，因为`PB=G-T`, 其中`G`是`Government Spending`, `T` 是`Tax Revenue`, 前者由政府绝对，后者通过`Fiscal Policy`决定，本质都由政府决定。
> - `Total Budget`中由于包含`total debt`, which is `rD`, 其中`r`作为名义利率，是由`Central Bank`控制的，而不是`Government`能直接控制的(at least in the US).
> - 所以我们需要做一个区分，哪些是政府能够完全掌控的，那些是会受到市场制约的。


## GB on the market for Goods and Services
>- Governments affect social welfare through many channels, including the ways that government budgets influence the market for goods and services.

# Chapter 8.2 Crowding in and Out
## Definition
> The true capacity of governments to influence aggregate demand depends on the degree of crowding out between public and private funds.
> ![](Chapter_8_Government%20Budgets.assets/image-20230321145853141.png)
> - `Crowding in` refers to a situation where `government spending stimulates private sector investment`, resulting in an `increase in economic growth`. This happens when government spending creates demand for goods and services, leading to an increase in production and profits, which in turn encourages private sector investment. As a result, the economy grows more than it would have without government spending.
> - `Crowding out` refers to a situation where `government spending reduces private sector investment`, resulting in a `decrease in economic growth`. This happens when government spending increases demand for resources such as labor, capital, and materials, which leads to an increase in their price. The higher prices reduce the profitability of private sector investment, and hence, firms may choose to reduce their investment, resulting in lower economic growth.


## Crowding Out 
### Why
> 🔔: How does crowding out happen?

## Crowding in
### Why
> ![](Chapter_8_Government%20Budgets.assets/image-20230321151050804.png)



## Comparison
> ![](Chapter_8_Government%20Budgets.assets/image-20230323135233207.png)
> 🔔: 本质上，`Crowding In`就是说人们都愿意相信政府借钱的行为能够给社会带来积极的影响，于是人们愿意将自己的钱借贷给政府，于是`LF Market`的`Supply`会增加。`Crowding Out`正好相反, 人们不愿意`Finance the government`。
> 🔔: 同时要注意，不管是`Crowding In`还是`Crowding Out`，`LF`的`Demand`都会增加，因为`AD=C+I+G`, 其中`Government Spending`会增加。




## Government Credibility

## Ricardian Equivalence
> - Ricardian Equivalence is an economic theory that suggests that `changes in government spending have no effect on the overall level of economic activity in an economy`.
> - According to the theory of Ricardian Equivalence, individuals are forward-looking and rational and understand that `any increase in government spending will eventually lead to an increase in taxes to pay for that spending `
> - `As a result, they save more in anticipation of future tax increases, which offsets the positive effect of increased government spending on consumption and investment`. In other words, individuals view government spending as a temporary increase in their disposable income, which they save in anticipation of future tax obligations, rather than a permanent increase in their wealth.
> - `This theory suggests that changes in government spending do not affect aggregate demand in the economy, as any increase in spending is offset by an equivalent increase in savings`. 
> - Therefore, `the theory implies that fiscal policy, which is the use of government spending and taxation to influence the economy, is ineffective in stimulating economic growth.` Instead, the theory suggests that monetary policy, which is the use of interest rates and the money supply to influence the economy, is more effective in stimulating growth.
> - 总的来说，`Richardian Equivalence`反应了一个社会现实：就是人们并不总是按照经济政策期望的那样给出反馈。


## Time Inconsistency
> ![](Chapter_8_Government%20Budgets.assets/image-20230323143543459.png)
> - Example is government giving subsidyies to factories or NBA team. 
> - If you come and build our commities within 2 years, you get a reward. But after 2 years, the government withdraw the subsidy.
> - This behavior is very common in real world, leading government to be less credibile.
> - So we need time consistency to ensure credubility.
> - They all affect the transmission mechanism of `fiscal policy`.
> - The tranmission mechanism of monetary policy depends on banks reducing real interest rate, when nomail interest rate go down. Or reduce the lending rate.
> - 总的来说, `Time Consistency`有助于`Fiscal Policy`的`Transmission Mechanism`, 也就有助于减少`Crowding out`的发生。
> ![](Chapter_8_Government%20Budgets.assets/image-20230323144308718.png)



## Business Cyles and Public Debt
> - When economy goes well, the public deficit goes down, because the government receives more taxes. 
> - When ecnonmy enters into the recession, the tax received go down, and the public deficit goes up. `If the economy is already in a recession and the government already has lots of debt, then the government will have less fiscal space to act`.
> ![](Chapter_8_Government%20Budgets.assets/image-20230323144730155.png)![](Chapter_8_Government%20Budgets.assets/image-20230323144950098.png)


## Fiscal Multipler
### Definition
> ![](Chapter_8_Government%20Budgets.assets/image-20230323145110065.png)
> - Building on the idea of crowding out and crowding in.
> - If the government can create the crowding in of public investments. If the government create a deficit today by increasing government spending, this will create more jobs, create consumption, private companies will invest more, tax receipts will go up, people will have more money. That's the idea behind fiscal policy.
> - If fm is `higher than 1`, it means that there is some measure of `crowding in`. Then any government spending (AD=C+I+G) will generate more than 100% increase in Y(GDP) over time. If fm is two, then one unit more spending from the  government spending will result in 2 more unit of growth in GDP. If G goes up by 100 billiob dollars, then Y will go up by 200 billion dollars.
> - If fm is `less than 1`, this means that there is some measure of `crowding out`. Companies will be more willing to spend less. If G increase by 10, then Y will  only increase by 8.

# Chapter 8.3 Hyperinflation
## How does hyperinflation happen?
> ![](Chapter_8_Government%20Budgets.assets/image-20230323150755264.png)
> - 也就是说政府的信用水平已经不足以让其通过发放债券来还款。
> - Not just about printing money. Simply printing money won't easily cause hyperinflation.
> - It is a result of lack of credibility. Paying for things only by printing money.
> - Not likely to happen in rich country. 



## Zimbabwe Case
> ![](Chapter_8_Government%20Budgets.assets/image-20230323151237539.png)
> 只能废除本国货币来`restore credibility`.



## Missing Hyperinflation
### US Case
> ![](Chapter_8_Government%20Budgets.assets/image-20230323151519288.png)![](Chapter_8_Government%20Budgets.assets/image-20230323151947023.png)
> - In the US case, the low inflation or low interest rate happens because the transmission mechanism is not functioning well so that the financial side of ecnonmy won't affect the real side of economy.



### Japan Case
> ![](Chapter_8_Government%20Budgets.assets/image-20230323152456386.png)
> - Japan people trust that the government won't let things go out of control. So crowding in happens and that government debt can keep high because Japanese Government make people think that they can stimulate the economny.
> - So in the Japanese case, the mechaism is working well. The government create the impression that they can handle the tax revenue well and do good deeds to the society and thus people are willing to borrow money to the government. And that government don't have to increase the interest rate to decrease the total deficit. So the interest rate is low.




# Chapter 8.4 Determine Interest Rates
## Determine the Interest Rate
> ![](Chapter_8_Government%20Budgets.assets/image-20230323153222844.png)
> - Expectations pay a major role. 
> - $MV=PY$. If no one trust the government, then changing in $M$ will change the price level, and won't affect the GDP quantity in $Y$. 


## Complexity of Public Finances
> ![](Chapter_8_Government%20Budgets.assets/image-20230323153745409.png)
> - Not all government have the same ability to tax their own citizens. 
> - In some countries, people avoid taxes at all. Then government won't have the confidence in taxing people.



# Chapter 8.5 Instruments and public debt management
## Social Norms's Effect
> ![](Chapter_8_Government%20Budgets.assets/image-20230324105255236.png)![](Chapter_8_Government%20Budgets.assets/image-20230324105335683.png)
> - Social Norms dictate how th states collect and spend money.
> ![](Chapter_8_Government%20Budgets.assets/image-20230324105613088.png)
> - The stage of development also matters.


## Importance of Government Size
> ![](Chapter_8_Government%20Budgets.assets/image-20230324105746685.png)
> - The state capacity also matters. In china, state capacity is very high. No other country could do it. Or did it to the extent that China did. 
> - When we are saying that the transmission mechanism of the fiscal policy(low time inconsistency) to raise taxes to discourage the economic activities, we are assuming that the government have the legitimacy and power to do that.


## Public Debt Management
### Context Dependent
> ![](Chapter_8_Government%20Budgets.assets/image-20230324110136494.png)



### Conflicting Interests
> ![](Chapter_8_Government%20Budgets.assets/image-20230324110241487.png)
>  - There are many interest conflicts in the society.
>  - When government tries to create autoritative measures, the public authroties are the first to claim that they are not making enough money.
>  - Fiscal policy is very difficult to manage.
>  - In 2020 in china, how would upi distribute your money to the government. Most likely to the health center. Do we need to train people, test people. Too much to consider when deciding on public debt and spending.
