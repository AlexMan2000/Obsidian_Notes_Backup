# External Economics Model
## Definition
> `External economics of scale` refers to the cost savings that occur when multiple firms in the same industry or region benefit from shared infrastructure, resources, or knowledge. 
> - This can include things like access to specialized suppliers, transportation networks, skilled labor, or research and development facilities. 
> - As more firms enter the market and take advantage of these external economies, the overall cost of production decreases, leading to lower prices and increased output. 
> - External economies of scale can also lead to increased competition and innovation within the industry, as firms are able to invest in new technologies and processes that would be too expensive for individual companies to pursue on their own.

## Specialized Suppliers
> `Specialized suppliers are suppliers that provide goods or services that are specific to a particular industry or product.` These suppliers may have expertise in a particular area or may offer specialized equipment or materials that are required for a particular production process. 
> - For example, in the automotive industry, specialized suppliers may provide components such as engines, transmissions, or braking systems. 
> - In the aerospace industry, specialized suppliers may provide components such as avionics, landing gear, or propulsion systems. 
> - By working with specialized suppliers, firms can access the expertise and resources they need to produce high-quality products and remain competitive in their industry.


## Labor Market Pooling
> `Labor market pooling` is a type of external economy of scale where multiple firms in the same industry or region benefit from access to a larger pool of skilled workers. This can occur when firms are located in the same geographic area and can draw from the same labor market, or when firms collaborate to provide training or education programs for workers. By sharing the costs of training and development, firms can access a larger pool of skilled workers and reduce their individual costs of recruitment and training. This can lead to `increased productivity` and competitiveness within the industry.


## Knowledge Spillover
> Knowledge spillover refers to the `unintended transfer of knowledge or information from one firm or individual to another`. 
> - This can occur when firms are located in close proximity to each other, or when they collaborate on research and development projects.
> - Knowledge spillovers can lead to` increased innovation and productivity` within an industry, as firms are able to build on the ideas and discoveries of others. However, they can also lead to challenges around intellectual property rights and the protection of proprietary information.

> $Q$ is the total production. If there are $n$ countries, then each country produces $\frac{Q}{n}$ units.

> 🔔: `Second-mover disadvantage` refers to the challenges faced by a company that enters a market after a first-mover has already established a strong position. The second-mover may face higher costs of entry, such as increased marketing and advertising expenses, and may struggle to differentiate their product or service from the first-mover's. Additionally, the first-mover may have already established brand loyalty and customer relationships, making it difficult for the second-mover to gain market share.



# Agglomeration
> ![](Lecture%2018%20External%20Economics.assets/image-20230420225200580.png)
> The reason for agglomeration are based on the cost of infrastructure, being close to the suply chain, and consumer market, labor pooling.


## Definition
> `Agglomeration` refers to the concentration of economic activity in a particular geographic area, often due to the presence of external economies of scale. This can lead to a clustering of firms and industries, as well as a concentration of skilled labor, specialized suppliers, and other resources.


## Benefits of Agglomeration
> - `Cost savings`: Firms located in an agglomeration can benefit from shared infrastructure, resources, and knowledge, leading to lower costs of production and increased competitiveness.
> - `Increased innovation`: Agglomerations can foster innovation and creativity, as firms and individuals are able to collaborate and build on each other's ideas and expertise.
> - `Access to specialized resources`: Agglomerations can provide access to specialized suppliers, skilled labor, and other resources that may be difficult or expensive to obtain elsewhere.
> - `Networking opportunities`: Firms located in an agglomeration can benefit from networking opportunities and the exchange of ideas and information with other firms and individuals in the same industry.


## Examples of Agglomerations
> - `Silicon Valley`: A region in California that is home to many of the world's largest technology companies, as well as a thriving startup ecosystem.
> - `Wall Street`: A street in New York City that is home to many of the world's largest financial institutions and investment banks.
> - `Fashion District`: A neighborhood in Los Angeles that is home to many fashion designers, manufacturers, and suppliers.


## Criticisms of Agglomeration
> - `Increased competition`: Agglomerations can lead to increased competition and market saturation, making it difficult for new firms to enter the market.
> - `Higher costs of living`: Agglomerations can lead to higher costs of living, as demand for housing and other resources increases.
> - `Negative externalities`: Agglomerations can also lead to negative externalities, such as traffic congestion, pollution, and urban sprawl.


## Additional Information

### Types of Agglomerations
There are different types of agglomerations based on the nature of the economic activity and the industries involved. Some examples include:

# Dynamic comparative advantages
## Definition
> `Dynamic comparative advantage` refers to a country's ability to gain a competitive advantage in a particular industry or product over time, through investments in research and development, innovation, and technology. 
> - This can lead to increased productivity, lower costs of production, and higher quality products, which can make a country more competitive in the global market. 
> - Dynamic comparative advantage is often contrasted with static comparative advantage, which is based on a country's natural resources or existing factors of production.
