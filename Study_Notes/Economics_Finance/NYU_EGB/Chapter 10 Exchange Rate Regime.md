# Free Floating Regime
> A` free-floating exchange rate regime` is a type of exchange rate system in which the value of a currency is determined by the market forces of supply and demand without any government intervention. In this system, the exchange rate is allowed to fluctuate freely based on the market conditions, and the central bank does not attempt to influence the exchange rate by buying or selling its currency. This type of regime is often used by developed countries with strong economies and financial markets.

# Over/Undervalued fixed exchange rate
## Overvalued Fixed Exchange Rate
> - An overvalued fixed exchange rate is a situation where a country's currency is set at a higher value than its actual market value. This means that the exchange rate is fixed by the government or central bank at a level that is higher than what the market would naturally determine. This can make the country's imports cheaper and more attractive to domestic consumers, but it can also make its exports more expensive and less competitive on the global market. Overvalued fixed exchange rates can lead to a trade deficit, as the country imports more than it exports, and can also lead to a loss of competitiveness for domestic industries.

## Undervalued Fixed Exchange Rate
> An undervalued fixed exchange rate is a situation where a country's currency is set at a lower value than its actual market value. This means that the exchange rate is fixed by the government or central bank at a level that is lower than what the market would naturally determine. This can make the country's exports cheaper and more competitive on the global market, but it can also lead to inflation and a loss of purchasing power for domestic consumers. Undervalued fixed exchange rates are often used by developing countries as a way to boost their exports and attract foreign investment.


# Free Capital Flows
## Definition
> Free capital flows refer to the unrestricted movement of money and investments across borders without any government intervention or restrictions. This means that individuals and businesses can invest in foreign countries, transfer money, and repatriate profits without any limitations or barriers. Free capital flows are often seen as a key component of a globalized economy and are believed to promote economic growth and development by allowing capital to flow to where it can be most productive. However, they can also lead to financial instability and volatility, particularly in emerging markets, if large amounts of capital flow in and out quickly.
