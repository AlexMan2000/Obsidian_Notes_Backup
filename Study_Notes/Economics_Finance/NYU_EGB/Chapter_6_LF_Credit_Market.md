# Chapter 6.1 Components&Concepts
## Financial Actors
> 1. `Savers`: Individuals, companies, and governments who `have excess funds that they want to lend out`. These savers can lend their money in the loanable funds market in exchange for a return, typically in the form of interest. `主要影响Supply Side of the LF Market`.
> 2. `Borrowers`: Individuals, companies, and governments **who need to borrow funds to finance their operations or investments**. These borrowers can access the loanable funds market to obtain the necessary funds to finance their activities. `主要影响Demand Side of the LF Market`.
> 3. `Financial intermediaries`: Banks, credit unions, and other financial institutions that act as intermediaries between savers and borrowers. They collect funds from savers and lend them out to borrowers, charging an interest rate to cover their costs and earn a profit.



## Financial Indicators
> 1. `Interest rates`: The cost of borrowing or the return on lending money in the loanable funds market. Interest rates are determined by the supply and demand for loanable funds, and they play a crucial role in balancing the market. 比较关键
> 2. `Risk`: The level of risk associated with lending and borrowing funds in the loanable funds market. Different borrowers have different levels of risk, which affects the interest rate they are charged to borrow funds. Savers also assess the risk associated with lending their money to different borrowers before deciding where to invest their funds.




## Credits
> Credit is an important factor in the loanable-funds market. It refers to the **ability of borrowers to obtain funds on the basis of their creditworthiness, which is determined by their credit history, income, assets, and other factors that affect their ability to repay the loan. **简单的说就是信用水平。
> 

> In the loanable-funds market,** lenders assess the creditworthiness of borrowers before extending credit. **Lenders want to ensure that they will be repaid with interest and therefore are more likely to lend to borrowers with a good credit rating. Borrowers with a poor credit rating may find it difficult to obtain credit, or may be charged a higher interest rate to reflect the higher risk associated with lending to them.
> 
> **Credit plays a crucial role in determining the interest rate in the loanable-funds market. **
> - Borrowers with a good credit rating are likely to receive a lower interest rate since lenders view them as less risky. 就是可以慢慢还，还的很少。利率低代表风险低。
> - Borrowers with a poor credit rating may be charged a higher interest rate to reflect the higher risk of default. 利率高代表次贷。
> 
> **Loanable funds include all forms of credit, such as:**
> 1. Commercial banks' loans 
> 2. Corporate and government bonds
> 3. Savings deposits. It includes private and public borrowing and lending.
> 
> The credit market is based on one of the most important economic identities: S = I, where S is aggregate saving, and I is aggregate investment.** Saving is identical to investment.** **In other words, what people in the economy save is used for companies and governments to invest—the crucial variable that generates economic growth in the long run.**



### Bank Loans
> When a borrower applies for a bank loan, the lender evaluates their creditworthiness to determine the risk of lending to them. The lender may consider factors such as the borrower's credit history, income, assets, and other factors that affect their ability to repay the loan. Based on this assessment, the lender decides whether to approve the loan and what interest rate to charge.


### Government Bonds
> Government bonds are another form of credit, where a government issues a bond to raise funds from investors. In exchange for purchasing the bond, investors receive a fixed rate of interest over the bond's term and are repaid the principal amount at maturity. Government bonds are generally considered a safe investment since they are backed by the credit of the government.
> 
> When a government issues a bond, it is essentially borrowing money from investors. The government promises to repay the bond's face value at maturity and pays periodic interest payments to the bondholder. 



### Savings Deposits
> Isn't necessarily a credit.



## Supply Side
>🔔:The supply of loanable funds in the loanable fund market refers to the total amount of funds available for borrowing by households, businesses, and governments. 
> **This supply is determined by the savings behavior of households and the investment behavior of businesses and governments.**
> - Household比较好理解，就是我往银行里存的钱会被银行以贷款的形式发放出去，那么这笔贷款就会以Loanable fund的形式流入LF Market.
> 
  🔔: Households are the primary source of savings in the economy. They may save money by setting aside a portion of their income, or by investing in financial assets such as stocks or bonds. The savings from households are then made available to the loanable fund market through financial intermediaries such as banks, credit unions, and investment funds.
> - Business比较难理解，就是公司会把钱留着以后投资, 投资都是要讲究回报的，所以本质上投资也是一种贷款(把钱借出去这个行为)，只是还款人往往是被投资的项目承包商。
> 
  🔔: Businesses and governments also contribute to the supply of loanable funds by investing in capital projects, such as building factories, infrastructure, and public works. These investments may be financed by issuing bonds or borrowing from financial institutions.
> 总的来说就是把钱借出去这个行为。
> The supply of loanable funds is influenced by a range of factors：
> - Interest rates, inflation, economic growth, and government policies. For example, higher interest rates may encourage households to save more, increasing the supply of loanable funds, while government policies such as tax incentives for investment may increase the investment behavior of businesses and governments, also contributing to the supply of loanable funds.
> 总的来说，`Supply Side` is about `Saving Motives`





## Demand Side
> The demand for loanable funds in the loanable fund market refers to the amount of funds that households, businesses, and governments want to borrow to finance their consumption or investment activities. 
> 
> **Most of the demand comes from firms that need credit to invest in economic expansion, but households and governments also can demand credit (to consume part of their future income)**
> 本质上就是借钱（把钱借到手这个行为），或者贷款投资这个行为。
> Households may demand loans to finance consumption such as buying a house or a car, while businesses may **demand loans to invest** in new projects or to expand their operations. Governments may also demand loans to finance public infrastructure or other projects.
> 
> **影响因素：**
> The demand for loanable funds is influenced by a range of factors, including interest rates, economic growth, and government policies. Higher interest rates tend to reduce the demand for loans as they increase the cost of borrowing, while lower interest rates tend to stimulate demand for loans. Economic growth and government policies that encourage investment can also increase the demand for loans.
> In addition to interest rates and economic factors, the demand for loans may also be influenced by the availability of credit, the borrower's creditworthiness, and the terms and conditions of the loan. For example, borrowers with higher credit scores may be able to access loans at lower interest rates, while those with lower credit scores may face higher interest rates or be unable to access credit at all.
> 总的来说，`Demand Side` is about `Investment motives`.

# Chapter 6.3 Loanable Fund Market
## Basic Mechanisms
> - The loanable funds market `determines the amount of aggregate saving and investment in the economy`.
> - Investment affects the economy in the short run; after all, it is part of aggregate demand.
> - Aggregate saving is important to mobilize resources for long-run projects. Investment turns into capital. Saving allows companies to borrow, produce now, and pay back the loans with the cash flow from successful operations. 
> - The loanable funds model captures the changing patterns of saving and investing.

# Chapter 6.4 Public Debts
> One of the main barriers that prevent central banks from affecting the credit market is the `trajectory of public debt`.




## Central Banks如何控制利率
> ![image.png](Chapter_6_LF_Credit_Market.assets/20230319_2143109294.png)
> 本质就是通过发行/购入债券来调整Money Market中的Loanable Fund的体量达到控制实际利率的目的。

# Chapter 6.5 Integrating Three Models
## Connection between MM, LFM and MGS
> 本质上我们现在有三种`Markets`:
> 1. `Money Market`: 需求是`MD`, 供给是`MS`(竖直向下，完全刚性) 
> 2. `LF Market`: 需求是`DLF`, 供给是`SLF`， `Equilibrium`决定了`Real Interest Rate`和`Aggregate Investment(I)` 
> 3. `Markets for Goods and Services`: 需求是`AD = Consumption+Aggregated Investment(I) + Government Savings`
> 
**Money Market-> LF Market的逻辑链条是这样:**
> `Central Bank`可以通过印发或者销毁货币来控制`Money Market`的`MS`, 进而控制货币总量和名义利率。
> `Central Bank`也可以通过`Oepn Market Operations`(发放或者购回债券)来调控`Money Market`的`MS`。
> 如果`Central Bank`是`Credible`的话，这种`MS`的波动会影响`Loanable Fund`中的`SLF`波动。

## Supply-Side Economics
> ![](Chapter_6_LF_Credit_Market.assets/image-20230321103408710.png)
> The argument goes like this: lower taxes boost companies’ willingness to invest, which increases economic growth in the short run (through investment in the aggregate demand) and prosperity in the long run (through the accumulation of capital).

> 涓滴经济学是一个术语，用来描述这样一种观点：给予富人的税收减免和其他经济利益最终会 "涓滴 "到社会的其他部分，导致所有人的经济增长和繁荣。这一理论与供应方经济学密切相关，后者强调提高经济中生产和生产力的重要性。
> 涓滴经济学的支持者认为，通过减少对富人和企业的税收和监管，他们将有更多的资金用于投资和创造就业机会，这将最终使经济中的每个人受益。他们还认为，政府对经济的干预可能是有害的，自由市场是促进经济增长的最佳方式。
> 涓滴经济学的批评者认为，它不会导致广泛的经济增长，而且它有利于富人而不是社会其他成员。他们指出，对富人的减税并不总是导致投资或就业的增加，而且实际上会加剧收入不平等，使许多人的经济状况恶化。
> 总的来说，涓滴经济学的有效性仍然是经济学家和政策制定者争论的话题，对于它是否是促进经济增长和繁荣的有效方式没有共识。
