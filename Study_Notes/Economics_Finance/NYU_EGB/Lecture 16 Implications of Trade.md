> 我们只需要记住一点: $\frac{\Delta W}{\Delta C}=-\frac{P_c}{P_w}$， 所以斜率的绝对值越大，`Cloth`相对于`Wheat`的价格就越高。
> 上图中就是随着生产的`Cloth`越来越多，`Cloth`的相对价格就越来越高。
> ![](Lecture%2016%20Implications%20of%20Trade.assets/image-20230419174942502.png)
> 如果没有`Trade`, 则我们只能取$S_0$， 也就是`Indifference Curve`和`Production Possibility`相切的地方。
> 如果有`Trade`, 因为图中$S_0$ 处`Wheat Price`要比`World Price of Wheat`低，所以在国内我们会更多的生产`Wheat`在国际上高价卖出。所以我们会从$S_0$移动到$S_1$。

## Combined with Solow Model
> [Solow Model Definition](Chapter_3_Solow_Model.md#Solow%20Model%20Definition)中介绍了$Y=f(K,AL,AN)$的公式。
> 假设: `Producing wheat use more labor, and producing cloth use more capital`, 则我们有:
> - 如果某次科技革命使得生产`Wheat`和`Cloth`都受益了(`doesn't favor any specific sector`)，则我们的`PPC`的面积会向外扩张(同心圆结构)。`Save the same extent of labor and capital`.
> ![](Lecture%2016%20Implications%20of%20Trade.assets/image-20230419192914256.png)
> - 如果某次科技革命`save both labor and capital, but save more capital than labor`(the technology that is more capital intensive, allow society to use relatively more capital than labor it also saves labor, but it saves more capital).
> ![](Lecture%2016%20Implications%20of%20Trade.assets/image-20230419193702727.png)
> - Improvement in the technology means, for the same factor of production, capital and labor, we can produce more.
> - Technology increases potential output.(Output frontier in microeconomics).


## Trade Summary
> Trade allows us to consume relatively more of goods that a country is not good at producing.

## Countries with similar PPC
> ![](Lecture%2016%20Implications%20of%20Trade.assets/image-20230419191924464.png)
> 🔔: There is no need to trade, since each country has the same comparative advantage pattern.

# Analysis of effects of trade
## Assumptions
> ![](Lecture%2016%20Implications%20of%20Trade.assets/image-20230419195528344.png)



## Factor Abundance&Intensity
> ![](Lecture%2016%20Implications%20of%20Trade.assets/image-20230419195730069.png)
> 🔔: Factor Abundance is relative, not absolute, this is why we need ratio.



### Heckscher - Ohlin Theory
> ![](Lecture%2016%20Implications%20of%20Trade.assets/image-20230419195852917.png)
> 🔔The goal of the theory is to analyze the effect of trade on income inequality. Inequality in different sectors. China is abundant in labor, then the price of goods tht use labor will go down in the outer key. The payment to the labor will be relatively lower. So in china in outer key, labor will be cheap, natural resources will be expensive since they don't have much.
> In Japan, capital will be cheaper, natural resources will be relatively expensive.
> 🔔: Relative is key.




### Examples
> ![](Lecture%2016%20Implications%20of%20Trade.assets/image-20230419200414180.png)
> 💡 Japan and UK are labor abundant, Canada and US are land abundant. So Canada and US will sell land-based products(because it is cheaper to produce domestically and sells highly in world trade market), and Japan&UK will sell labor-based products.
> ![](Lecture%2016%20Implications%20of%20Trade.assets/image-20230419200933088.png)
> 🔔 Factor abundance points to the comparative advantages for each country.
> The more abundance we have in one factor, the cheap(lower opportunity cost)would be for the factor-related products, and thus more comparative advantage from that product.



###  Graphical Model
> ![](Lecture%2016%20Implications%20of%20Trade.assets/image-20230419201334016.png)
> 🔔和之前不同的是，横轴上面是$\frac{Q_c}{Q_w}$(`Relative Quantity`), 纵轴是$\frac{P_c}{P_w}$(`Relative Price`)。
>  ![](Lecture%2016%20Implications%20of%20Trade.assets/image-20230419201627033.png)
> `Assumption: The relative demand of the US is tha same as the relative demand in ROW.` Everybody in the world(US and ROW), we want to consume cloth and wheat relatively the same way, So there will only be one demand curve.
> From the graph we see:
> - The ROW produce relatively more cloth.
> - The US produce relatively more wheat.
> Putting together we see:
> ![](Lecture%2016%20Implications%20of%20Trade.assets/image-20230419212615791.png)
> When US and ROW trade, the supply of the world will be in the middle.
> If we have free trade, if poeple have the same need. People will end up consuming relatively the same stuff.




### Convergence of Price
> - As one economy trades with another, there will be price convergence. The world price converges in relative terms as the world trade opens(Heckscher - Ohlin Model)
> - Heckscher - Ohlin Model says that there is a convergence of prices given that relative differencing in endowments will lead to conuntry specializing partially trading with each other.(Assuming no trade cost, friction, so absolute convergence) .
> - Convergence in price is the heart of the model.

> Permanent change in the income distribution.
> In China, low-skilled workers benefit more than high-skilled workers. Low-skilled people benefits most.


## Trade&Unemployment
> Trade doesn't lead to unemployment.
> If the relative price of wheat goes up, land will be relatively more used. The country will allocate more land for the growth of wheat.
> Will have change in income distribution, but not unemployment.
