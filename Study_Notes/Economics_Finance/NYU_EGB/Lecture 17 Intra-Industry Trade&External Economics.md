# Intra Industry Trade
## Definition
> Trade inside the same industry
> - Is China a Car exporter? Yes
> - Is china a Car importer? Yes
> So car is an intra industry trade.
> `Intra-industry trade` refers to the `exchange of goods and services between countries within the same industry or sector`. This type of trade involves countries importing and exporting similar or identical goods and services with each other.
> For example, intra-industry trade occurs when a country exports cars to another country while simultaneously importing cars from that same country. `This type of trade is common in industries that produce differentiated goods`(差异化商品), such as automobiles, pharmaceuticals, and electronics.
   `Benefits:` Intra-industry trade can benefit countries by allowing them to specialize in producing certain goods and services while importing others, leading to increased efficiency and lower costs. It can also result in increased competition and innovation within industries, as countries compete to produce higher quality goods at lower prices.
> `Disadvantages:` However, intra-industry trade can also lead to job displacement and economic dislocation in certain industries as countries shift production to where it is most efficient, potentially leaving certain workers or regions behind.



## Differentiated Goods
> Differentiated goods refer to products that are similar in nature but have distinct features, characteristics, or qualities that make them different from one another. - These products are not perfect substitutes for each other and can be differentiated in terms of their design, packaging, branding, or other attributes that set them apart from similar products.
> - For example, smartphones from different brands, such as Apple, Samsung, and Huawei, are all differentiated products as they have unique features, designs, and brand images that distinguish them from each other. Similarly, different types of coffee, such as espresso, latte, and cappuccino, are differentiated products that cater to different preferences and tastes.
> Differentiated products are typically associated with industries that invest heavily in research and development, marketing, and branding to create unique and differentiated products that appeal to consumers. Examples of such industries include technology, pharmaceuticals, automobiles, and consumer goods.
> - Differentiation can also create barriers to entry, as companies with established brands and customer loyalty can have an advantage over new entrants. However, competition can still exist within the market as consumers have the freedom to choose products based on their preferences, leading to continued innovation and differentiation in the industry.




# Intra Industry Trade Index
## Definition
> - `Intra-industry trade (IIT)` index is a measure of the trade of similar goods between countries within the same industry. The index is calculated by dividing the value of intra-industry trade by the sum of intra-industry trade and inter-industry trade. Intra-industry trade occurs when a country exports and imports similar goods in the same industry. 
> - `Inter-industry trade`, on the other hand, refers to the exchange of goods between countries in different industries.
> - The IIT index ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating a higher degree of intra-industry trade. A value of 0 indicates that a country only exports or imports goods in one industry, while a value of 1 indicates that a country is exporting and importing similar goods in the same industry.
> - The IIT index is used to measure the level of economic integration between countries and to determine the competitiveness of industries. It is also used to identify trade patterns and to analyze the impact of trade policies on different industries.

## Monopolistically Competitive Industry
> A monopolistically competitive industry is a market structure in which there are many firms selling differentiated products that are similar but not identical, and firms have some degree of market power due to product differentiation. This market structure is characterized by the following key features:

### Many Firms
> There are a large number of firms in the market, each producing a slightly differentiated product. Entry and exit into the market are relatively easy, which means that new firms can enter or existing firms can exit the industry without significant barriers.


### Differentiated Products
> Each firm in a monopolistically competitive industry produces a product that is distinct from its competitors, either in terms of quality, design, brand, or other attributes. This product differentiation creates a perception of product diversity among consumers.
    

### Some degree of market power
> Firms in a monopolistically competitive industry have some control over the price of their product due to product differentiation. However, this market power is limited as there are close substitutes available in the market, and consumers can easily switch to alternatives if prices or other factors change.
    

### Non-price Competition
> Firms in monopolistically competitive markets often engage in non-price competition, such as advertising, product differentiation, and marketing efforts, to attract customers and create brand loyalty.
    
### Relatively Easy Entry and Exit
> Firms can enter or exit the industry relatively easily, as there are low barriers to entry and exit. This means that the number of firms in the industry can change in response to market conditions.
    

### Real Life Scenario
> Monopolistic competition is commonly found in industries such as restaurants, clothing, consumer goods, and personal care products, where firms differentiate their products through branding, advertising, and other marketing strategies to attract consumers and create a loyal customer base.


### Result
> Trade integration brings higher variety with lower price. If there is no trade, you won't find many options in the market.
> A country that has been kicked out of trade.




# Intra-Industry Trade with Monopolistic Competition
## Example
> ![](Lecture%2017%20Intra-Industry%20Trade&External%20Economics.assets/image-20230420105400624.png)
> 🔔Assumption for the following analysis:
> - All firms sell at the same price so that $Q=S*\frac{1}{n}-0$(Since $P=\bar{P}$)
> - By saying that there is 6 firms in the graph(x-axis), we are saying that consumers can only access 6 firms in the country.
