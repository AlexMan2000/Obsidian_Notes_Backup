# 1 Definition of Economics
## Definition
> **Economics is a social science that examines how people choose among the alternatives available to them. **It is social because it involves people and their behavior. It is a science because it uses, as much as possible, a scientific approach in its investigation of choices. (pp.13)
> **Accurate Description of Microeconomics:**
> 1. A set of constrained optimization problems.
> 2. Analyzing tradeoffs.
> 3. Studying how individuals and firms make themselves as well off as possible given conditions of scarcity.



## Scarcity
> **Definition and Examples:**
> - Our resources are limited but our wants are unlimited. So to say yes to one thing means to say no to another(alternatives), where we have to make a choice.
> - **Scarcity implies that we must give up one alternative in selecting another. A good that is not scarce is a free good.**Not all goods confronts us with having to find the alternatives. The gravity is free of charge and will not restrict other people from using it. 
> - There are not many free goods. Since goods can be free or not based on how we use them. If outer space can only be used for gazing, then outer space is free and will not have confronting problems. But if outer space are used to accomodate increasingly more space satellites, then it is not free and will suffer from confrontation.
> 
**Fundamental Economics Problems:**
> 1. What will be produced? 要**生产什么**? 
>    - Using the economy's scarce resources to produce one thing requires giving up another.
>    - Producing better education requires cutting back on other services like health care.
> 2. How should goods and services be produced? 商品和服务要**如何生产**?
>    - Employ a lot of unskilled workers or a few skilled workers.
>    - Produce at home or abroad.
>    - Use new or recycled materials to produce.
> 3. For whom should goods and services be produced? 商品和服务要**生产给谁**?
>    - If a good or service is produced, a decision must be made about who will get it. 
>    - A decision to have one person or group receive a good or service usually means it will not be available to someone else. 



## (Opportunity) Cost
> Every choice has an opportunity cost and opportunity costs affect the choices people make. The opportunity cost of any choice is the value of the best alternative that had to be forgone in making that choice.
> Opportunity cost is the value of the best alternative forgone in making any choice.



## Exercises
> **Identify the elements of scarcity, choice, and opportunity cost in each of the following:**
> 1. The Environmental Protection Agency is considering an order that a 500-acre area on the outskirts of a large city be preserved in its natural state, because the area is home to a rodent that is considered an endangered species. Developers had planned to build a housing development on the land.
>    - **Scarcity: **500-acre area.
>    - **Choice: **Choose **preservation in its natural state** between **a site for homes**.
>    - **Opportunity Cost: **The _opportunity cost_ of _using the land as a housing development _is the _forgone value of preserving the land_.
> 2. The manager of an automobile assembly plant is considering whether to produce cars or sport utility vehicles (SUVs) next month. Assume that the quantities of labor and other materials required would be the same for either type of production.
>    - **Scarcity: **The use of plant and labor.
>    - **Choice: **Produce cars or SUV.
>    - **Opportunity Cost: **The opportunity of producing cars should be the forgone benefits/profits earned if the plant use the same materials to produce SUVs.
> 3. A young man who went to work as a nurses’aide after graduating  from high school leaves his job to go to college, where he will obtain training as a registered nurse.
>    - **Scarcity: **Time is scarce.
>    - **Choice: **Stick to current career or to pursue college education.
>    - **Opportunity Cost: **The opportunity cost of sticking to current nurse' aids is the forgone benefits(salaries or social status) from going to the college and getting trained to be a registered nurse. 



# 2 The field of economics
> - Economists focus on the opportunity costs of choices, they assume that individuals make choices in a way that maximizes the value of an objective defined in terms of their own self-interest, and they assume that individuals make those choices at the margin.
> - Economics is divided into two broad areas: microeconomics and macroeconomics.
> - A wide range of career opportunities is open to economics majors.  Empirical evidence suggests that students who enter the job market with a major in economics tend to earn more than do students in most other majors. Further, economics majors do particularly well on the LSAT.

## Basics
> **Economists study choices that scarcity requires us to make. This fact is not what distinguishes economics from other social sciences; all social scientists are interested in choices.** 
> - An anthropologist might study the choices of ancient peoples.
> - A political scientist might study the choices of legislatures.
> - A psychologist might study how people choose a mate.
> - A sociologist might study the factors that have led to a rise in single-parent households. 
> 
**Economists study such questions as well. What is it about the study of choices by economists that makes economics different from these other social sciences?**
> 1. Economists give special emphasis to the role of opportunity costs in their analysis of choices.
> 2. Economists assume that individuals make choices that seek to maximize the value of some objective, and that they define their objectives in terms of their own self-interest.
> 3. Individuals maximize by deciding whether to do a little more or a little less of something. Economists argue that individuals pay attention to the consequences of small changes in the levels of the activities they pursue.
> 
**Economic Thinking:**
> 1. The emphasis economists place on **opportunity cost**.
> 2. The idea that people make choices that maximize the value of objectives that serve their self-interest
> 3. A focus on the effects of small changes are ideas of great power. 



## Opportunity Costs Are Important
> As the set of available alternatives changes, we expect that the choices individuals make will change. The emphasis on opportunity costs is an emphasis on the examination of alternatives. 



## Individuals Maximize in Pursuing Self-Interest
> **Economists assume that:**
> - Individuals make choices that they expect will _**create the maximum value of some objective**_, _given the constraints they face_.
> - **People' s objectives** will be those that _serve their own self-interest_.
> 
**For example:**
> - Economists assume that_ the owners of business firms seek to maximize profit_. Given the assumed goal of profit maximization, economists can predict how firms in an industry will respond to changes in the markets in which they operate.
> - Similarly, **economists assume that maximizing behavior is at work when they examine the behavior of consumers**. 
> - In studying consumers,  economists assume that individual consumers make choices aimed at maximizing their level of satisfaction. 
> 
**Self-interestedness& Selfishness:**
> - In assuming that people pursue their self-interest, economists are not assuming people are selfish. People clearly gain satisfaction by helping others, as suggested by the large charitable contributions people make. 
> - Pursuing one's own self-interest means pursuing the things that give one satisfaction. It need not imply greed or selfishness.



## Choices are made at the margin 
> Choices in water consumption, like virtually all choices, are made at the margin. Individuals do not make choices about whether they should or should not consume water. Rather, they decide whether to consume a little more or a little less water. 
> When we examine the choice to consume water at the margin, the notion that a higher price would reduce consumption seems much more plausible. Prices affect our consumption of water because choices in water consumption, like other choices, are made at the margin.




# 3 Economists' Tool Kits
> **Economics differs from other social sciences because of:**
> 1. Its emphasis on opportunity cost.
> 2. The assumption of maximization in terms of one's own self-interest.
> 3. The analysis of choices at the margin.


## Models in Economics
> Any description of the relationship between two or more economic variables.



## Fallacy of false Cause
> Reaching the incorrect conclusion that one event causes another because the two events tend to occur together is called the fallacy of false cause. (Correlation Causality)




## Normative and Positive Statements
> Two kinds of assertions in economics can be subjected to testing.
> **Normative Analysis: **What things should be? People should not be allowed to purchase bodily organs, because it allows the rich access to a life-saving procedure that the poor may not have access to. 
> **Positive Analysis: **What things are? The demand for organ transplants currently far exceeds the supply.



> **Key Assumption in microeconomics?**
> Individuals maximize utilities and firms maximize profits.
> **Distinction between empirical and theoretical economics?**
> Theoretical economics builds models, and empirical economics test them.
