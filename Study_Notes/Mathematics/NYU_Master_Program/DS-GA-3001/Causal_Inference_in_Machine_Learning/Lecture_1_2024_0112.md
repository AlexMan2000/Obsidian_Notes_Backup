# Probabilistic Graphical Model
> [!concept]
> Recall the definition of a graph, which is $G=(V,E)$ where $V$ is a set that contains all the vertices in the graph and $E$ contains all the edges.
> 
> The probabilistic graphical model is built on top of the di-graph(directed graph). where $V=\{v_1,v_2,\cdots,v_n\}$ and $E=\{(v_i,v_j)\}$.

> [!def]
> We define the probability of a graph to be
> $$p(V)=\prod_{v\in V}p(v|pa(v))$$ where $pa(v)$ is the parent node of $v$, defined to be $pa(v)=\{v'|(v',v)\in E\}$
> We define the marginal probability
